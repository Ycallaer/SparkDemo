# DAT202.3x

The exercises are coming from the edx course: DAT202.3x
All credit for the base code of the labs goes to microsoft and edx

Instead of using azure as a source (and having to go to the trouble of setting up azure infra) I'd rather work on my local machine.

So I've set up a local spark cluster on my machine and adapting the code where necessary so it can run from Intellij directly towards my local spark cluster

I'm running spark 2.2.1 pre built for apache hadoop 2.7
This version can be download directly from the spark website
