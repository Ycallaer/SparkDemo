# SparkDemo
The exercises are coming from the edx course: DAT202.3x

Instead of using azure as a source (and having to go to the trouble of setting up azure infra) to do data analytics I'd rather work on my local machine.

So I've set up a local spark cluster on my machine and adapting the code where necessary so it can run from Intellij directly towards my local spark cluster
